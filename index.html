            <h3>"Hey so what's your deal"</h3>
            <p>
                My name is Josh Yang, in case you skimmed the header or forgot. I'm currently enrolled at WeCanCodeIT, a five-star full stack web developer course. I have a passion for just about anything that challenges the mind, and I hope to be a developer someday.
            </p>
            <h3>"Okay, are you good at anything"</h3>
            <p>
                Glad you asked! No. I'm working on it though. I'm currently learning Object-Oriented Programming in C# and HTML5/CSS for front-end web design. By the end of the course, I will be proficient in C# .NET Core Active Server Pages / ASP.net, JavaScript, Flexbox, MVC, HTML, CSS, Grid, TDD, Agile (Scrum), Object Oriented Programming (OOP), AJAX, JSON, React, Restful APIs, Responsive Design / Mobile, Structured Query Language (SQL), Relational Databases / MS SQL, and Source Control / GitHub.

            <h3>"I mean that's mildly unimpressive, but are you cute at least"</h3>
            <p>Yeah! I clean up nice. Here's a selfie.</p>

            <p>
                Here are three projects I've completed in the first four weeks of study. I'm proud of all of them and learned a lot in the process, so please be nice.

                    <img src="virtual pet screenshot" alt="">
                    <p>
                        In a similar vein as Tamagotchi, my teammates and I created a text-based virtual pet simulator, where you can interact with a user-created pet in various ways.

                    <p>
                        While learning the basics of HTML/CSS, I created a simply styled and elegant web page for a fake company called "Code Business."

                    <p>
                        For our mastery project at the end of our first module, my partner and I designed a backend interface for hospitals to view employee information and access their payrolls, as well as have their doctors and nurses interact with patients at the hospital.
