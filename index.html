                    <p>
                        In a similar vein as Tamagotchi, my teammates and I created a text-based virtual pet simulator, where you can interact with a user-created pet in various ways. (C#, OOP)
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        While learning the basics of HTML/CSS, I created a simply styled and elegant web page for a company called "Code Business." (HTML5, CSS)
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For our mastery project at the end of our first module, my partner and I designed a backend interface for hospitals to view employee information and access employee payrolls, as well as have their doctors and nurses interact with patients at the hospital. (C#, OOP)
