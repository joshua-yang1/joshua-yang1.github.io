            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm currently enrolled at WeCanCodeIT, a five-star full stack web development course. I entered the world of coding when, at my former job as a client services rep, the CEO of the company approached me and told me that I was hilariously overqualified for my current job, and I should look into something more challenging and tailored to my skillset, like coding. I researched bootcamps, had a talk with the head developer at my office, and fell in love with the concept.
            </p>
            <p>
                I grew up in South Florida to a family of professional musicians, and spent my free time learning music and playing video games. I was particularly drawn to the computer at an early age, and once I had a computer of my own, I immediately began picking apart the code of my favorite video games, as well as the appearance of the operating system.
            </p>
            <p>
                After I graduate from the course, I plan on looking for a job as a junior developer and moving forward with this exciting new path.

                    <p>
                        In a similar vein as Tamagotchi, my teammates and I created a text-based virtual pet simulator, where you can interact with a user-created pet in various ways. (C#, OOP)

                    <p>
                        While learning the basics of HTML/CSS, I created a simply styled and elegant web page for a company called "Code Business." (HTML5, CSS)

                        For our mastery project at the end of our first module, my partner and I designed a backend interface for hospitals to view employee information and access employee payrolls, as well as have their doctors and nurses interact with patients at the hospital. (C#, OOP)
