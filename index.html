            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>
                Here are three projects I've completed in my first four weeks of study:

                    <h3>Virtual Pet Simulator</h3>
                    <img src="./images/pet.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>
                        In a similar vein as Tamagotchi, my teammates and I created a text-based virtual pet simulator, where you can interact with a user-created pet in various ways.

                    <h3>Code Business Website</h3>
                    <img src="./images/business.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>
                        While learning the basics of HTML/CSS, I created a simply styled and elegant web page for a company called "Code Business."
                    </p>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <h3>University Clinic Hospital</h3>
                    <img src="./images/hospital.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>
                        For our mastery project at the end of our first module, my partner and I designed a backend interface for hospitals to view employee information and access their payrolls, as well as have their doctors and nurses interact with patients at the hospital.
